Right now, this project is a strikeout (K) prediction model for MLB starting pitchers, built using historical Statcast data and a LightGBM machine learning pipeline(switched from XGBoost). The current implementation focuses solely on forecasting strikeouts based on a pitcher’s recent performance and game context, with features like handedness, home/away splits, and recent pitch metrics. We’re actively working to expand the model to predict additional pitching outcomes — including walks allowed, runs allowed, pitches thrown, and pitching outs recorded — so it can become a more comprehensive pitcher performance projection tool. These additions will enable deeper analysis, multi-stat forecasting, and potentially more robust betting and fantasy insights.
